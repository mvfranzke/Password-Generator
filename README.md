# Module-3-Challenge (Javascript Password Randomizer)
## Description
This is the third assignment or challenge for our bootcamp class, we're given a starter code(on-the-job ticket) in which we will modify and build up on to complete the challenge. In this assignment we have to create a password generator for a company to help employees make their account more secure. Upon clicking on generate password button, it will give a prompt to the user to enter how many characters they want to have, it should have a minimum of 8 characters. Then user will receive an alert asking them if they want to include special characters, lower-case letter, number and/or upper-case letter, atleast one character type must be selected. The final password will then reflect on the text area.
